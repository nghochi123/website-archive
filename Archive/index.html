                    <p>October 2018 was when I graduated from Hwa Chong Institution, and I would say that it was a bittersweet moment as on one hand, I was freed from the pressure and stress of examinations, albeit temporarily, and on the other hand, that was probably the last time I would be in a school environment with all my friends and teachers.</p>

                    <p>My team and I set off to Canada to battle it out with international competitors for the title of World Champions. Our team migrated to Arduino and stayed back after school for hours on end to learn the new programming language and syntax. It was a stressful yet fun time for me as there were many unexpected and anger-inducing problems along the way, but blasting music and working together with the company and help from my peers and juniors made it far more tolerable and fun for me. Unfortunately, we didn't do too well internationally as we faced immense competition, far stronger than our Singapore peers. However, our CCA got a confidence boost from our Singapore victory and started making bigger and better plans for the future.</p>

                    <p>I enrolled in HCI in January 2017 after doing unexpectedly well in my O'Level examinations which turned out to be one of the best desicions of my life as I was able to meet certain people and have some unique experiences I probably wouldn't be able to had I chosen to go to another school. I got accepted into the Science and Math Talent Programme where I had some amazing teachers and met some extremely intellectually gifted yet humble people who were willing to lend a helping hand whenever possible. I entered the Hwa Chong Infocomm and Robotics Society where I met some unique and quirky personalities who were so passionate about their projects that it inspired me immensely as well. In this CCA, I was also able to get once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that I would not be able to get otherwise.</p>

                      I've been learning Python for a while now and have come across the library pyautogui thanks to Al Sweigart's Automate The Boring Stuff with Python. This was the most interesting library I've come across so far and I decided to do some stuff with it. 
                      Nothing much, all simple stuff, but it was quite a challenge to me, especially since I've never coded something longer than 200 lines before.

                      I experimented with a Raspberry Pi 3 I had at home to try to send data from the Raspberry Pi over the internet. I've learnt how to use SSH to connect my pc to control linux computers (my RPi here) from my main laptop with PuTTY and VNC Viewer.
                      Here, I used a simple circuit to test whether two wires are connected.

                      I used a python script on my Raspberry Pi as well as a PHP script on the database to send 'Connected' or 'Not Connected' to the database based on whether the wires are connected. If there is no change, nothing is sent. This uses the $_GET superglobal variable
                      to grab data from HTML links. For example, in this website, <code>https://www.randomwebsite.com/script.php?variable=value</code> the 'variable' with value of 'value' will be saved into $_GET and we can access the variable.
                      This is then sent to the database with SQL through another php script.

                      This is the circuit board I created. It's extremely simple with just 2 resistors and 5 connecting pins. I was thinking of making it into a lock-checking system (if is unlocked, last value sent to database would be not connected) but did not actually go ahead with it. 
                      Unfortunately, there would be no further continuation of this project.
