# My Website

Hi, this is my attempt at making a personal website/app/portfolio using React.

It's a minimalistic site that's hosted by Netlify. Was trying to experiment with the React-Spring library but I guess it was kind of overkill.

All are welcome to visit and give criticism where necessary thanks.

## Motivation

Wanted to have a personal website/portfolio that I could use alongside with my resume to show my skills to potential employers, to
give myself a good gauge of how much I've been improving so far, as well as to have a collection of projects that I've done over time.

## Tech/Frameworks used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Reactstrap (React implementation of Bootstrap)](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
- [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)
